# [QuitNow!](http://quitnowapp.com)'s sleeping time
Be sure that your user is awake before disturbing it with soundy and vibrant notifications!

Before this library, QuitNow! and lots of apps were sending notifications when the user was sleeping... and HEY! That makes people angry. So, before setting the sound of that notifications and asking the phone to vibrate arround five minutes, write this lovely line:

```java
new SleepingTime().isSleepingTime();
```

We've done it using TDD, so it's totally tested. [Check the tests!](https://github.com/Fewlaps/quitnow-sleep-time/tree/master/src/test/java/com/fewlaps/quitnowsleepingtime) :Â·)

The sample
----------

```java
SleepingTime st = new SleepingTime(); //By default, it uses the Locale of the phone
st.isSleepingTime(); //Is it a bad moment to do noise?
st.getBedtime(); //The average bedtime of the user's country, based in its Locale
st.getWakeUp(); //The average wake up of the user's country, based in its Locale

new SleepingTime("es")).isSleepingTime(); //You can also force a country code
```
